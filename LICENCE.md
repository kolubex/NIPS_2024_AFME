# Data Clause: Licence, Terms of Use, Data Maintenance and Reporting Issues

## Terms of Use
This dataset is solely intended for use as a benchmark for evaluating vision-language models under the constraints of the licence. This dataset is strictly not to be used for training under any circumstances.


## Licence
The VISOGENDER dataset only contains URLs that reference images that (at the time of curation) are under Creative Commons and/or royalty free licences that allow for their use and distribution. No images are stored directly. The VISOGENDER dataset is bound under a CC-BY 4.0 licence and is used as such by the authors. However, it is important to note that individual images in the model may have licences that do not allow commercial use, and users of this dataset will assume liability if they use the dataset beyond the terms of use as indicated by the benchmark. The authors do not take responsibility for any licences that change with time.

The authors confirm that, to the best of their knowledge, they are using all intellectual property in accordance with their licences, and the use of the data as stipulated in this terms of use and the accompanying manuscript and GitHub repository does not violate any rights. The GDPR allows the processing of personal data for research purposes and only includes the URLs so there is no personal data shared.


## Dataset maintenance
The URLs are curated manually, and at the time of collection in April - May 2023, they did not point to any images containing harmful or disturbing imagery, nor do any images depict children. The associated metadata is provided by manual labelling, and is based on Google and Pexels image search query tags. In order to maintain the dataset, the authors undertake to do the following: 
- The authors will proactively investigate the dataset for broken links, with randomised checks of the images themselves to ensure URLs are not redirecting every 6 months 
- We have uploaded code and instructions to GitHib for easy command line running of a script which checks for URL integrity and that the images can be utilised by models.      
    - This will be run by the authors every 6 months 
We also welcome feedback and scrutiny from the community making use of the benchmark. In order to facilitate this process, we put forward the following:
- We have included instructions for running the code to check the dataset,
- Further, we have included a Google Form which can be used to identify broken and/or inappropriate links

## Reporting and/or addressing issues with the dataset
In the event that there are any issues with the dataset, or any specific links to images, or associated images, please contact the authors by filling out this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/UAYZ44d2CmaTB9PA7) and any offending information will be removed immediately. These issues can include, but are not limited to issues with deprecated links, links that have redirected to disturbing, inappropriate content, or you would like images related to yourself, personally removed.
